# How To Get The Dataset:

Firstly, download the [Dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Waterhorse/chess_data/tree/main/chessclip_data/annotated_pgn) and unzip it using any tool of your choice.

Afterwards, open [PGNtoCSV.py](https://github.com/Lopes30787/CARLSy/blob/main/PGNtoCSV.py) and change the directory variable to the path to the Gameknot directory in the dataset you just unzipped.
Additionally, change the dataset variable to the path where you want the dataset CSV file to be created in.

Now just run the program as normal and the dataset should be created without any problems!
